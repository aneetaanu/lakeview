<h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
<p>At Lifetime Dentistry of Royal Palm in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, our team won't only help guide you through the
entire dental care process, but we also provide emergency dental care in order to make sure your concerns are immediately 
addressed during business hours. In case of a dental emergency, you can have the peace of mind that you have professionals 
to assist you quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Emergency Dental Care</h3> 
<p>Even with an optimal oral hygiene routine in place, unexpected dental issues can arise. One of the most common problems that result in the need for
immediate emergency dental care is teeth sensitivity. Such a situation can result from any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#">Tooth decay</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Cavities</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Chipped teeth</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Gingivitis</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Gum issues</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Abscess</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, immediate action is important to eliminate pain and reduce the risk of the condition worsening.
Our emergency dental care service provides a convenient option for addressing such issues quickly.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>Crowns</h3>
<p>
Crowns are covers for your teeth that protect them from further damage. This device is commonly used with treatments designed to cure abscesses because
they protect the weakened tooth from cracks and chips. There are several types of crowns,
and we suggest that you schedule an appointment so that our dentist can determine if a crown is the right solution for you.</p>
<p>Our dentist and staff work to ensure that all of our services are carried out with proper precision and care. Visit our dental 
office at Lifetime Dentistry of Royal Palm in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, for a personal consultation to identify current issues and develop 
a comprehensive treatment plan. If you're in need of exceptional dental services, contact us at 561-814-2138 to schedule an appointment today.
We're here to assist you with all of your dental care needs!</p>

<h3>Services We Provide</h3>
<p>Our team is committed to ensuring you are cared for and have provided an overview, below, that will better help you understand some of the services we provide.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>Teeth Cleaning</h3>
<p>Teeth cleaning is usually the first service that many of our patients experience. A thorough teeth cleaning helps remove stains and reduces the risk of cavities. </p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>Invisalign</h3>
<p>Invisalign utilizes clear teeth aligners that are less noticeable than metal braces. They are also removable, making them an excellent choice for those who prefer versatility.
Our dentist may recommend evaluating your Invisalign aligners every few weeks to ensure the process is carried out effectively.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>iTero Dental Impressions</h3>
<p>iTero Dental Impression is a simple scanner to obtain a clearer and instant image of teeth. To perform this procedure, the scanner makes use of 3D digital scans and 
offers patients a more convenient and comfortable digital imaging experience.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>Digital X-rays</h3>
<p>A digital x-ray is one of the most important advancements in dentistry. The technology replaces conventional X-rays with advanced electronic sensors.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>Oral Cancer Screening (VELscope)</h3>
<p>As the name indicates, the equipment is especially used for the screening of oral cancer. While oral cancer is rarely fatal, it can be a major problem if it 
is not diagnosed or treated in a timely manner. This technology helps identify abnormal tissue development that commonly results in cancer. It also helps inspect 
abnormal changes in other parts of the mouth, such as the tongue.</p>
